```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      eval = TRUE)
```

```{r load}
library(knitr)
```

Machine learning algorithms used include: `r snakemake@params[['ml_methods']]`.
Models were trained with `r snakemake@params[['nseeds']]`
different random partitions of the data into training and testing sets using
`r snakemake@params[['kfold']]`-fold cross validation.

## Model Performance

```{r perf_plot, out.width='80%'}
include_graphics(snakemake@input[['perf_plot']])
```

## Hyperparameter Performance

```{r hp_plot, out.width='80%'}
include_graphics(snakemake@input[['hp_plot']])
```

## Memory Usage & Runtime

```{r runtime_plot, out.width='80%'}
include_graphics(snakemake@input[['bench_plot']])
```

Each model training run was given `r snakemake@params[['ncores']]` cores
for parallelization.
