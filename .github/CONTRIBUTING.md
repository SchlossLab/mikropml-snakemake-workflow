This document was adapted from the [Tidyverse Contributing guide](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/CONTRIBUTING.html).

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation
directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the
_source_ file.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's needed.
If you've found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

*   Fork the repo and clone onto your computer.

*   Install all [conda and
    mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) if you
    don't already have them.

*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR).

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.
